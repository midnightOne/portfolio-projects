This guide helps resolve common issues with AI configuration and usage in the Portfolio Projects application.

## Quick Diagnostics

### Check AI Status

1. Navigate to `/admin/ai-settings`
2. Check the "Environment Configuration" section
3. Look for green checkmarks or red error indicators
4. Use "Test" buttons to verify connections

### Common Status Indicators

- ‚úÖ **Connected**: API key is valid and working
- ‚ùå **Failed**: API key is invalid or connection failed
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Not configured**: API key is missing from environment
- üîÑ **Testing**: Connection test in progress

## Environment Configuration Issues

### Problem: "Not configured" Status

**Symptoms:**
- API key shows "Not configured"
- Provider section is grayed out
- Test button is disabled

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   # Verify variables are set
   echo $OPENAI_API_KEY
   echo $ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Add Missing Variables**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-your-key-here"
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-your-key-here"
   ```

3. **Restart Development Server**
   ```bash
   # Stop server (Ctrl+C) then restart
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check File Location**
   - Ensure `.env.local` is in project root
   - Not in subdirectories or with different names

### Problem: API Key Not Loading

**Symptoms:**
- Environment variable is set but not detected
- Status still shows "Not configured"

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Variable Names**
   ```bash
   # Correct names (case-sensitive)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
   
   # Wrong names (will not work)
   OPENAI_KEY=sk-proj-...
   ANTHROPIC_KEY=sk-ant-api03-...
   ```

2. **Check for Extra Characters**
   ```bash
   # Wrong (has quotes)
   OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-proj-..."
   
   # Correct (no quotes in .env.local)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-...
   ```

3. **Verify File Encoding**
   - Ensure `.env.local` is UTF-8 encoded
   - No BOM (Byte Order Mark)
   - Unix line endings (LF, not CRLF)

## Connection Testing Issues

### Problem: "Invalid API key" Error

**Symptoms:**
- Test connection fails with authentication error
- Error message mentions invalid or expired key

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify API Key Format**
   ```bash
   # OpenAI keys start with sk-proj- (newer) or sk- (older)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-abcd1234...
   
   # Anthropic keys start with sk-ant-api03-
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-abcd1234...
   ```

2. **Check Key Status in Provider Dashboard**
   - **OpenAI**: Visit [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - **Anthropic**: Visit [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/)
   - Verify key is active and not expired

3. **Regenerate API Key**
   - Create a new key in provider dashboard
   - Update environment variable
   - Restart development server

### Problem: "Rate limit exceeded" Error

**Symptoms:**
- Connection test fails with rate limit message
- Error mentions too many requests

**Solutions:**

1. **Wait for Rate Limit Reset**
   - OpenAI: Usually resets every minute

   ```

2. **Check Firewall Settings**
   - Ensure outbound HTTPS (port 443) is allowed
   - Check corporate firewall restrictions
   - Try from different network if possible

3. **Verify Proxy Settings**
   ```bash
   # If using proxy, set environment variables
   export HTTP_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
   export HTTPS_PROXY=http://proxy.company.com:8080
   ```

## Model Configuration Issues

### Problem: No Models in Dropdown

**Symptoms:**

   - Test connections in AI settings
   - Verify models are configured for working providers

2. **Configure Models**
   ```
   # In AI Settings, add models:
   OpenAI: gpt-4o, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-3.5-turbo
   Anthropic: claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022, claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
   ```

3. **Save Configuration**
   - Click "Save Configuration" button
   - Wait for success message
   - Refresh page if needed

### Problem: Model Validation Warnings

**Symptoms:**
- Yellow warning icons next to model names
- "Model may not be available" messages
- Models still work but show warnings

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Model Names**
   ```
   # Correct OpenAI models
   gpt-4o
   gpt-4o-mini
   gpt-3.5-turbo
   
   # Correct Anthropic models  
   claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022
   claude-3-5-haiku-20241022
   claude-3-opus-20240229
   ```

2. **Update Model Lists**
   - Check provider documentation for latest models
   - Remove deprecated models
   - Add new models as they become available

3. **Ignore Warnings for New Models**
   - Warnings may appear for very new models
