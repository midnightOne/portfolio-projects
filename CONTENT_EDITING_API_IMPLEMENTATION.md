# Content Editing API Implementation Summary

## Overview

Successfully implemented Task 6 "Content Editing API" from the AI Architecture Redesign specification. This includes all required endpoints for AI-powered content editing and model configuration management.

## Implemented Endpoints

### 6.1 Content Editing Endpoints

#### POST /api/admin/ai/edit-content
- **Purpose**: Handles AI-powered content editing operations
- **Operations**: rewrite, improve, expand, summarize, make_professional, make_casual
- **Features**:
  - Full content replacement or partial text updates
  - Context-aware editing with project information
  - Structured JSON response with reasoning and confidence
  - Support for text selection editing
  - Tag suggestions based on content changes

#### POST /api/admin/ai/suggest-tags
- **Purpose**: Analyzes project content and suggests relevant technology/skill tags
- **Features**:
  - Intelligent tag inference from project content
  - Suggestions for tags to add and remove
  - Confidence scoring for each suggestion
  - Reasoning for each tag recommendation
  - Configurable maximum suggestions limit

#### POST /api/admin/ai/improve-content
- **Purpose**: Specialized content improvement endpoint
- **Features**:
  - Focused on general content enhancement
  - Grammar and style improvements
  - Clarity and readability enhancements
  - Maintains author's voice and intent

### 6.2 Model Configuration Endpoints

#### GET /api/admin/ai/model-config
- **Purpose**: Retrieves current AI model configuration and general settings
- **Returns**:
  - Model lists for each provider (OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - General settings (default provider, system prompt, parameters)
  - Provider connection status
  - Configuration validation status

#### PUT /api/admin/ai/model-config
- **Purpose**: Saves AI model configuration and general settings
- **Features**:
  - Updates model lists for providers
  - Saves general settings (temperature, max tokens, system prompt)
  - Validates model configurations against provider APIs
  - Returns validation results and warnings

#### GET /api/admin/ai/available-models
- **Purpose**: Retrieves all available AI models grouped by provider
- **Features**:
  - Lists models from all configured providers
  - Groups models by provider (OpenAI, Anthropic)
  - Includes availability status for each provider
  - Filters out models from providers without valid API keys
  - Provides unified model list for dropdowns

## Key Features

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error classification and handling
- Actionable error messages with specific guidance
- Proper HTTP status codes (400, 405, 500)
- Graceful degradation when providers are unavailable

### Request Validation
- Required field validation for all endpoints
- Operation type validation for content editing
- Provider type validation for configuration
- Model ID validation against configured models

### Response Structure
- Consistent success/error response format
- Structured data with metadata (tokens used, cost, timestamps)
- Detailed reasoning for AI operations
- Confidence scoring for AI suggestions
- Warning messages for edge cases

### Security & Best Practices
- Method restrictions (only allowed HTTP methods)
- Input sanitization and validation
- Environment variable-based API key management
- No sensitive data in responses

## Integration Points

### AI Service Manager
- All endpoints integrate with the existing AIServiceManager class
- Utilizes provider abstraction layer for OpenAI and Anthropic
- Leverages model configuration and validation methods
- Uses structured prompt building and response parsing

### Database Integration
- Model configuration stored in AIModelConfig table
- General settings stored in AIGeneralSettings table
- Proper upsert operations for configuration updates
- Database validation and error handling

### Provider Support
- OpenAI provider integration with cost calculation
- Anthropic provider integration with model validation
- Dynamic provider availability checking
- Real-time connection testing

## Testing

### Unit Tests
- Comprehensive test suite for endpoint structure validation
- Request/response format validation
- Error handling verification
- File existence verification

### Verification Scripts
- Automated endpoint verification script
- Structure and method validation
- Error handling confirmation
- Response format checking
